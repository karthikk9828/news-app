The program “News Application” is basically a voice based news headlines reader which gives the user the audio version of the latest news on the web or the internet. The two major technologies used in this program are web-scraping and text to speech conversion. Web scraping or Web data extraction is a data extraction technique used for extracting data from websites, in this case from news websites. Text to speech conversion is the process of converting the text format of the data to the audio or speech format. This is done using Google Text to Speech (gTTS) API.
